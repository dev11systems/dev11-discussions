# dev11-discussions  
### Central hub for dev://systems — discussions, updates, roadmaps, and cross-project coordination.

This repository hosts **all organization-wide Discussions** for the dev://systems ecosystem.  
Use this space to share ideas, ask questions, propose changes, explore frameworks, and coordinate across all projects.

## 🧭 Purpose
The `dev11-discussions` repository acts as the **Town Square** for the organization:

- Announcements & updates  
- Cross-project planning and meta-coordination  
- Feedback, Q&A, and brainstorming  
- Explorations related to UCF, Liberated Intelligence, Root Sequence, and other initiatives  
- A place to connect threads across all dev://systems work

If you want to talk about *anything that spans multiple repos*, this is the right place.
